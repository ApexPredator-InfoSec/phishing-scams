# phishing-scams
This repos is where I will post some identification and analysis of phishing and scam attempts I recieve. I will attempt to create a table of IPs, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and domain names associated with various scams. It won't be an end all be all list of scammers but eventually may be a decent sized list.
